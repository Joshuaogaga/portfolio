                    <p class="text-primary ">The recent decade has witnessed a significant boom in Technology. 
                        Technology has become more user-friendly and accessible over the years. This improvement 
                        in accessibility has led to dramatic growth in the number of users. Providing individual 
                        technical support to each and every customer could often prove to be hectic and 
                        tedious.</p>

                        A chatbot is an AI-based digital assistant that can understand human capabilities and 
                        simulate human conversations in natural language to give prompt answers to their 
                        questions just like a real human would. Chatbots help businesses increase their 
                        operational efficiency by automating customer requests.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                        This Chatbot Assistant is developed to help customers get technical help for their 
                        queries. Moreover, the user-friendly design of this project improves accessibility for 
                        users. As the number of users within a system grows, their queries and issues will 
                        also inadvertently increase. Tackling each and every query personally could prove to 
                        be expensive, time-consuming and inefficient.

                    <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                        This Chatbot Assistant aims to streamline the process of providing technical help by 
                        automating the process. Instead of waiting for their issues to be resolved by a 
                        representative, users can directly approach the chatbot for help and get the answers 
                        to their questions. Moreover, the easy-to-use nature of this system improves 
                        accessibility for the customers.

                    <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                        The most important task of a chatbot is to analyze and understand the intent of a 
                        customer request to extract relevant entities. The bot then delivers an appropriate 
                        response to the user based on the analysis. Natural language processing plays a vital 
                        role in text analytics through chatbots making the interaction between the computer 
                        and human feel like a real human conversation.
